This repo contains all the necessary files from Module 7 from the Data Science Tools Course from UBC. Assignment_07. 

The assignment explores the advanced features of JupyterLab - a web-based interactive development environment for working with Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. It will cover different cell types, markdown text formatting, opening additional views of the same notebook, rendering cell output on the side of a code cell, running shell commands, using magic commands, graphical debugger, and workspaces. These features can enhance your productivity when working on data science projects, and by the end of this assignment, you will have a better understanding of how to use them effectively.
